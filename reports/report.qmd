# Problem Background


```{python}
from helpers import create_database_engine, run_sql_and_return_df, run_sql_and_return_html, create_db_wrapper, execute_ddl_from_file, execute_ddl

# Load these variables from .env file.
config_map = {
  'user': "CMSC408_HW8_USER",
  'password': "CMSC408_HW8_PASSWORD",
  'host': "CMSC408_HW8_HOST",
  'database': "CMSC408_HW8_DB_NAME"
}

cnx,config = create_db_wrapper( config_map )
  
```


```{python}
# Do a quick test of the connection and trap the errors better!

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  table_schema, table_name, table_rows
from
  information_schema.tables
where
  table_schema in ('world_bank_data')
""")

```

# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns
## Do you see any blanks or missing data?
## (skills: select, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

list all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## which records are not for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## how can you tell?
## once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select *
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where is_country = 0;
""")
```

## Task 4

create your own copy of wdi_country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## the wdi table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using create table ... select from where syntax.
## finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists wdi_country_copy;
""")

# create table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
create table wdi_country_copy as
select *
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where is_country = 1;
""")

# show number of records
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select count(*) as "number of countries"
from wdi_country_copy;
""")
```

## Task 5

according to the world bank, in 2020 there were how many countries in the world?

```{python}
## (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select count(*) as "number of countries in 2020"
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where is_country = 1;
""")
```

## Task 6

what are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## let's investigate the country_region field.
## what is the domain of the country_region field? that is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in sql)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select distinct country_region
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
order by country_region;
""")
```

## Task 7

how many countries are in each region?

```{python}
## how many countries are in each region?
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_region, count(*) as "number of countries"
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where is_country = 1
group by country_region
order by country_region;
""")
```

## Task 8

list the country full names and regions for all countries in north america.

```{python}
## list the country full names and regions for all countries in north america
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_full_name, country_region
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where country_region = 'north america'
order by country_full_name;
""")
```

## Task 9

```{python}
## the last world cup soccer tournament was hosted by qatar.
## what region contains qatar?  list the region, country short name and full name
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_region, country_short_name, country_full_name
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where country_short_name = 'qatar';
""")
```

## Task 10

```{python}
## there are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## list the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_code, country_short_name, country_abbr, country_wb_abbr, country_region
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where country_abbr != country_wb_abbr
order by country_code;
""")
```

## Task 11

```{python}
## now, let's investigate the "income category" field.
## list the income categories and the number of countries in each
## income category in descending order of most countries to least.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select income_category, count(*) as "number of countries"
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where is_country = 1
group by income_category
order by count(*) desc;
""")
```

## Task 12

```{python}
## mystery task.  looking at the table from task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.
## at a minimum, your query should put country short name in the first column.
## you will be scored on the number of records returned and the value(s) 
## in the first column.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_short_name, income_category
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where income_category is null
order by country_short_name;
""")
```

## Task 13

```{python}
## ok, this has to be an error. let's make a assumption that the country 
## in question, because they are oil-rich, are "high income".  
## write an update comment to correct the issue.
## note - if you get this wrong, all subsequent tables will be wrong!

# update income category
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
update world_bank_data.wdi_country
set income_category = 'High income'
where country_short_name = 'Specific Country Name';
""")

# verify the change
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select *
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where country_short_name = 'Specific Country Name';
""")
```

## Task 14

```{python}
## write a single query that show the number of countries in each 
## "region"-"income group" pair.  the table should have 3 columns:
## region, income group, and no.of.countries.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_region, income_category, count(*) as "number of countries"
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where is_country = 1
group by country_region, income_category
order by country_region, income_category;
""")
```

## Task 15

```{python}
## examine the result from task 14. it would be really cool to
## present the results of this table in a 2-d form, with 
## columns for each income category (high, upper middle, lower middle, low, other)
## regions down the side, and the pair-wise count inside each cell.
## using case statements, do it!  be sure to include the countries without
## an income category.

## hint - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., high, upper middle, etc.)
## and a column for the row totals.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_region,
       sum(case when income_category = 'High income' then 1 else 0 end) as High,
       sum(case when income_category = 'Upper middle income' then 1 else 0 end) as Upper_Middle,
       sum(case when income_category = 'Lower middle income' then 1 else 0 end) as Lower_Middle,
       sum(case when income_category = 'Low income' then 1 else 0 end) as Low,
       count(*) as Total
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where is_country = 1
group by country_region;
""")
```

## Task 16

```{python}
## wow! what a cool table!  it is very interesting to see where the money
## sits around the world.  using the general approach from task 14 above
## and write a query to return the single region with the most lower-income
## countries.

## your query should return 3 columns, the number of 
## low-income countries, the region name and the income group

## put the number first! (use: count, region name, income group)
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query, order by, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select count(*) as "number of low-income countries", country_region, income_category
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where is_country = 1 and income_category = 'Low income'
group by country_region, income_category
order by count(*) desc
limit 1;
""")
```

## Task 17

```{python}
## are you getting the hand of this? good! we need to take a look at all
## the countries in the same region and with the same income category as
## the marshall islands.
## for each country that matches, print their country code, short name,
## region and income category, by order of their short name.  as a hint,
## the country code for the marshall islands is mhl.
## (skills: select, where, subquery)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_code, country_short_name, country_region, income_category
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where country_region = (
    select country_region

    where country_code = 'MHL'
) and income_category = (
    select income_category
    from world_bank_data.wdi_country
    where country_code = 'MHL'
)
order by country_short_name;
""")
```

## Task 18

```{python}
## ok - let's raise the heat in the kitchen! review the output from task 14.
## you'll see that some of the regions do not contain all of the income
## levels.  for example, the europe & central asia region does not have
## any low income countries.
##
## challenge - using a single sql statement, write a table that contains every
## combination of region and income category (including the missing '') values!
##
## then add a where clause to only show the values that were missing from
## the original pairings!
##
## hint - there should be at most [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28
## rows in your final table, and there are 22 rows returned in the query
## in task 14.  (fyI - i get 6 rows in my final table.)
## (skills: select, where, subqueries, joins)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select r.country_region, i.income_category
from (select distinct country_region from world_bank_data.wdi_country) r
cross join (select distinct income_category from world_bank_data.wdi_country) i
left join world_bank_data.wdi_country w
on r.country_region = w.country_region and i.income_category = w.income_category
where w.country_region is null
order by r.country_region, i.income_category;
""")
```

## Task 19

```{python}
## hot enough, yet?  let's go for ghost-pepper hot!  now let's build some
## percentage tables.  for example, across the entire sample, what
## is the percentage of total countries in each income category?
##
## as a first step, build off the result from task 14 and create a table with
## six columns (region, income cat, country count, sum of countries in region,
## sum of countries by income and total sum countries).
##
## then, add a 7th column calculating the percent of total for each,
## region-income pair.
##
## actually calculating percentages and print out a table will be a
## slam dunk after this!
## (skills: select, where, subqueries, joins, aggregate functions)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_region, income_category, count(*) as country_count,
       sum(count(*)) over (partition by country_region) as region_total,
       sum(count(*)) over (partition by income_category) as income_total,
       sum(count(*)) over () as total_countries,
       count(*) * 100.0 / sum(count(*)) over () as percent_of_total
from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where is_country = 1
group by country_region, income_category;
""")
```

## Task 20

```{python}
## slam dunk time!  using the resulting table ctes from task 19,
## print table similar to the table in task 15, with income group in the
## columns, region in the rows and percent of total in each cell of the table.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select country_region,
       sum(case when income_category = 'High income' then percent_of_total else 0 end) as High,
       sum(case when income_category = 'Upper middle income' then percent_of_total else 0 end) as Upper_Middle,
       sum(case when income_category = 'Lower middle income' then percent_of_total else 0 end) as Lower_Middle,
       sum(case when income_category = 'Low income' then percent_of_total else 0 end) as Low
from (
    select country_region, income_category,
           count(*) * 100.0 / sum(count(*)) over () as percent_of_total
    from world_bank_data.wdi_country
    where is_country = 1
    group by country_region, income_category
) subquery
group by country_region;
""")
```

## Task 21

```{python}
## another dunk!  using the resulting table ctes from task 19,
## print a table listing the number, totals and percentage of countries
## by income category.

## (this is much simpler than task 20!)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select income_category, count(*) as country_count,
       sum(count(*)) over () as total_countries,
       count(*) * 100.0 / sum(count(*)) over () as percent_of_total
